# WorldeOnline

## Overview
Through the request of some of my friends, who are all dedicated Wordle players, they have asked me to create a project that allows them to compete against each other in a Wordle type game. They wanted to be able to try and guess the word in the least amount of guesses possible as well as have each other pick words that the other would have to try and guess.

## Current Status
This project has been in the works now for a few months whenever I get the chance to update this and when I have free time from school and other assignments that I am working on. I am hoping to complete this by the end of May 2023.
